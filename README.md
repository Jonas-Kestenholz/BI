# Sprint 1: Problem Formulation  
**Project Title:** Shopping Behaviour Analytics: Customer Segmentation and Purchase Prediction  

---

## Problem Statement & Purpose  
Retail businesses face the challenge of understanding diverse customer behaviours to improve marketing strategies, inventory management, and customer loyalty. With the *Shopping Behaviours* dataset, we aim to analyze demographic, transactional, and behavioural features of customers to uncover patterns that influence purchasing behaviour.  

The project will focus on predicting customer spending levels, identifying loyalty indicators (like subscription status and purchase frequency), and segmenting customers into meaningful groups based on behaviour. These insights can directly support business intelligence for personalized marketing, better product recommendations, and customer retention strategies.  

---

## Research Questions  
1. Which demographic and behavioural features (e.g., age, gender, location, frequency, subscription status) most influence purchase amount?  
2. Can we predict high-value vs. low-value customers based on their transaction history and behaviour?  
3. How do discounts, promo codes, and subscription status impact customer spending and retention?  
4. Can we cluster customers into meaningful segments (e.g., “bargain hunters”, “loyal subscribers”, “occasional big spenders”)?  
5. What actionable insights can these clusters and predictions provide for marketing and inventory planning?  

---

## Hypotheses  
- **H1:** Customers with active subscriptions and higher previous purchase counts will have higher purchase amounts and higher purchase frequency.  
- **H2:** Discounts and promo codes significantly increase the likelihood of higher purchase amounts, especially for price-sensitive segments.  
- **H3:** Customer demographics (age, gender, location) combined with behavioural factors (subscription, previous purchases, frequency) improve segmentation accuracy.  
- **H4:** Clustering will reveal distinct customer groups that can guide targeted marketing and personalization strategies.

## Annotation  
This project explores shopping behaviours to identify the drivers of customer spending and loyalty. Using demographic, behavioural, and transactional features, we will predict purchase amounts, analyze the role of discounts and subscriptions, and cluster customers into segments. The insights can help retail businesses personalize marketing campaigns, design loyalty programs, and optimize inventory. The positive impact will be stronger customer retention, improved revenue, and better alignment of business strategy with consumer needs.

## Plan of Work (Milestones)  

| Sprint | Deliverables |
----------------------
| Sprint 1 | Problem statement, hypotheses, project setup (GitHub repo, `.md` file, environment). 
| Sprint 2 | Load dataset, clean missing values/outliers, exploratory data analysis (visualizations of age, gender, categories, purchase behaviour). 
| Sprint 3 | Predictive modelling (classification of high vs. low-value customers, regression for purchase amount, clustering for segments). 
| Sprint 4 | BI dashboard/web app with insights: interactive filters by demographics, customer segments, and predictions; recommendations for business application.
